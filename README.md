# HigherDimensionalProjections
This project creates 4 Dimentional projections of simple 4D shapes onto a 2D surface â€” the computer screen. Using the shape specified, it plots the points in the 4D projection and connects them to create an intact shape. The mathematics of the projection ensures that the points appear in the screen in the correct location, creating an accurate spatial projection. The projection is be able to rotate around any axes (including the w-axis), allowing for a clearer understanding of the projection to be portrayed.

In the optional 3D-glasses mode, two 4D projections are layered and offset a small amount, allowing for the user to view the projection in 3D if they have 3D glasses. One of the projections is blue and the other is red; this is to be compatable with the 3D glasses lenses. Turning off the 3D glasses setting removes one of the layered projections and makes it black again.

This was my partner's and my senior project, which we entered into the science fair and recieved 3rd place in *Programming and Robotics* category, earning our way to the state science fair.
